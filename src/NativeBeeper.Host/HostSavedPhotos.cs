/// <see cref="SavedPhotos"/> (the same one the in-process app keeps on its PC: read once through the media reader as opening it would read it, kept once however
/// many saved messages show it, within the same 1 GB), and lets it go when the row is deleted. A device then opens a saved photo as it opens any photo, by
/// <c>media.read</c>, and the server's <c>MediaRouter</c> answers from this copy before it asks the service. Nothing is sent to any device ahead of that, so a
/// device fetches an original only when one is shown or opened; and none keeps a copy of its own (a client connected at 8 skips its own, SavedMessages).

/// already carries a picture by reference in chunks and already prefers this copy, so no method is added.</para>
/// <para><b>One try.</b> As on a PC, a photo is read once when its message is first seen in a run; one that could not be had is left to its conversation. The row is
/// seen once per run: a reminder's mark rewrites it, and the photos are not read again for that. A row that arrives while the server is down is kept when
/// the row is next written. The copies are named by the row's key (<see cref="SavedPhotos.Keep(SavedMessage, string)"/>), which is all that is left to name a message once
/// its row is deleted. An unsave the server missed (it stopped between the commit and the release) leaves a copy that the 1 GB budget takes out oldest first.</para>

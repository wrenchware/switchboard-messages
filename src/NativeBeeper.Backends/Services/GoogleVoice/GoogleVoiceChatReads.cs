// conversation. They share one read of that account's list rather than making one each. A read that began before a
// change is never shared with a caller reacting to that change, and never puts a summary that change made stale back in
// the cache. Only the changed conversations are left out: the rest of what it read is still current, and the caller still
// gets its answer from the read itself.

// What was still direct after the account actions (SWITCHBOARD.md 2.6d): mark read and typing out with their private-reading admission,
// link previews, and a history window with its later refresh. Typing in is not a method: it is the `typing` kind of the event feed.
//
//   Admission. PrivateReadingGate admits a read or a typing start with an AsyncLocal that cannot cross the dispatcher, so the request
//   carries `admitted` and the host applies it before its router decides (IAdmittedReadStateWriter, PrivateReadingHostReadState). The
//   client sets it only from the gate. A request that leaves it out is not admitted. `admitted` alone does not make the host tell a service about
//   a conversation it reads privately: the client's view of the choice can be behind another device's. The host admits only a read that also
//   says `explicit` (the person asked for it by name; the gate's explicit writer sets it), and decides every other read, and every typing start,
//   by its own view (HostClientState). A request from before `explicit` is therefore automatic. The host still trusts its authenticated client
//   (stage 3) that an explicit read is one.
//
//   Not journaled. A read marker is a watermark: sending it again leaves the conversation as read as it was, and the caller already sends
//   one for each time the conversation is seen. Typing is a state that expires on its own. An interrupted call is therefore an ordinary
//   failure (unavailable), and the next view of the conversation marks it read again.
//
//   Restarting a helper (3.0b, host.restartHelper). Not journaled either: it is not a send, and a repeat only restarts again, which the host
//   paces (one at a time per helper, Instagram's recovery budget). Every refusal and failure is the result's own outcome and fixed code word,
//   never an error, so the window words them as it always has. Sends still in flight after the host's wait end the first call as `asking`
//   with nothing stopped; the person's yes is a second call with `force`, which does not wait again. The sign-in windows are the client's,
//   so `signingIn` is the client's say-so, and it must be stated.
//
//   A window's refresh. HistoryWindow.Refreshed is a Task inside the result. The window comes back with a `refresh` token when the host
//   has fresher copies on their way, and `history.windowRefresh` is the call that waits for them: it answers once, with the rows, and the
//   token is spent. A call, not a pushed event, so it has an owner (it fails with the connection and can be cancelled), is not stored
//   in the resumable log, and goes to nobody but the caller.

// A keystroke changes the composer's text and the interface thread handles it in well under a millisecond, but what a
// person sees is the frame carrying that change, and the frame was not always coming. The characters then arrive at
// whatever rate frames happen to be produced instead of the rate they were typed, which reads as latency and, when a
// key repeats, as text moving in visible steps rather than one character at a time. Nothing about it is visible from
// inside the thread's own work: it is never blocked, it allocates nothing extra, and every counter reads zero.
//
// Asking for a frame every refresh for as long as the app is running would cost that for the whole session. Typing is
// bursty, so frames are requested from the first keystroke and until a short quiet period has passed, which covers the
// gaps between words without leaving the request standing while nobody is typing.
//
// This decides when; the view does the asking, because only it can reach the compositor.

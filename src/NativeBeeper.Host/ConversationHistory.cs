/// The server's whole copy of every conversation (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 8). Each conversation is held from its newest message down to a floor with no gap
/// between, filled from the service's newest page and kept up from the providers' events, which this sees first (<see cref="Over"/>). Every change takes the
/// next number of one sequence (<see cref="HistoryDatabase"/>), and a client asks only for what changed after the number it holds (<see cref="SyncAsync"/>), so
/// its copy is whole by construction. The same copy answers the reads every client version already makes (<c>messages.page</c>, <c>history.held</c>,
/// <c>messages.resolve</c>, the peeks): this stands in front of the router as each of those ports, and passes on whatever it does not hold.

/// <para>A conversation's state changes only once what it says is written: a read cancelled or failed half way leaves it as it was. What it holds is known
/// whole up to <see cref="State.Verified"/>, which only a page read, or an event while nothing was missed, moves. After a provider reconnects (or an event's
/// messages could not all be read) its conversations are suspect: events still write, but only a read of the newest page that reaches back to the verified
/// position (within <see cref="MaxCatchUpPages"/> pages) makes it whole again; one that cannot starts the conversation over, which tells every copy of it to

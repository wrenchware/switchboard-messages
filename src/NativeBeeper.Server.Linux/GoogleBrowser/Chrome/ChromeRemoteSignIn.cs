/// the X display it sits on (<see cref="ChromeScreenStream"/>), and what the person does goes in as real X input (<see cref="XInputTranslator"/>, <see cref="XInputRunner"/>). The server's part is
/// to read Chrome's cookie store from disk (<see cref="ChromeCookieStore"/>), which fills in as Chrome writes it, and when a NEW complete set of Google's account cookies is there, to hand it to the
/// pairing exactly as the sign-in of a client's own window does (the emoji reach the client as progress; a renewal stays a renewal).
/// <para>
/// The kept profile is never changed before the phone has accepted. The person signs in on a COPY of it (made while Chrome is closed, without its caches), or on a new profile when none is kept. The copy
/// replaces the kept profile only after the pairing succeeded (<see cref="GoogleMessagesBrowserProfile.KeepAsync"/>, with Chrome closed meanwhile); a cancel, a timeout, a refusal or a failure deletes the copy and
/// starts Chrome again on the kept profile, which is exactly as it was.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A sign-in is taken only when it is new. A set of account cookies that was already complete when the window opened is never taken, however long the window stays open or whatever the person is typing: it
/// is taken when the cookies that name the session (<see cref="ChromeRenewalLoop.SessionCookies"/>; not the timestamp cookies, which Google rotates by itself) are different from what was there. That holds for a
/// renewal and for a pairing as a new device alike. A person who finds Chrome already signed in therefore signs out and in again in the window. Chrome writes its cookie store every 30 seconds, so the
/// window can stay up that long after the sign-in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// One at a time (<see cref="SignInGuard"/>, and the one use of Chrome's display). Ended by the caller's cancel, 10 minutes without input, 20 minutes in all, or the display going away. Log lines are fixed words

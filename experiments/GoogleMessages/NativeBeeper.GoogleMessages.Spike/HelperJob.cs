// to the job closes, and this process holds the only handle, so however it ends — a normal exit, a crash, a fail-fast,
// Task Manager, the installer's Restart Manager — its helpers end with it. A helper sees end of input only between the
// calls it runs inline, so without this one that was mid-call outlived the app and a relaunch started a second helper
// on the same account's stores.
//
// Only helpers join, never this process, and never the WebView2 or browser sign-in windows: Chromium and Firefox build
// their own sandbox jobs, and a sign-in is not something to cut short because the app closed. No helper starts children
// of its own. A helper runs for the moment between Process.Start and the assignment outside the job, which is harmless
// for the same reason; Process.Start cannot create a process suspended to close that gap.

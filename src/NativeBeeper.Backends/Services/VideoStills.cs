// an iPhone's over RCS especially; Google Voice never does). The video is read whole the way playing it reads it, so
// pressing play afterwards finds it in the provider's own cache and downloads nothing, a frame is made from those bytes in
// memory (IVideoFrameExtractor), and that frame is kept in the protected media cache under its own key, so it is made once.
//
// Asked only by a tile that is on screen, and by nothing that sweeps ahead (MediaRouter.PrepareImageAsync does not come
// here). Concurrent asks for one video share one download and one extraction.
//
// Whom a frame is kept for is the caller's to say. In process it is the Google profile, as for every entry of the media cache. A
// client of a Messages Server makes its own frames (ClientVideoStills, 2026-10-12) and keeps them in a cache of its own under the
// server's id: its profile follows the server's Google pairing, and a server with Google unpaired would keep nothing.

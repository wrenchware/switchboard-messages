// How long something is allowed to take before the interface admits it is taking time.
//
// Most of the work these indicators stand for finishes in well under a second: a conversation row reads its summary
// back after a receipt, an open conversation waits for a provider that is already nearly connected. A swirl that
// appears and vanishes inside that time does not read as progress — it reads as a flicker, or as something wrong
// with the row it appeared on, and it is the only part of the app that moves while nothing is happening.
//
// So progress waits. Work that finishes first is never announced at all, and work that is genuinely slow still says
// so, a little later, which is the only case where saying it was ever useful. Two seconds because that is roughly
// where waiting stops feeling instant and starts feeling like waiting — and because the alternative, tuning it per
// indicator, would give the same app several different ideas about how long is too long.
//
// Kept here rather than as a number in each view model so both of them mean the same thing by it, and so a check can
// read it.

    // still appears once the period has passed if the connection is still missing.

// Tailscale on the server's page (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.7 and 10.8, D9): the door set up from here rather than from the container's log. Signing the server in (a button
// and the same link as a QR code, for signing in on a phone), signing in again when Tailscale signed it out, approving it, and a checklist of what is left, each line
// in plain words with a link to the exact page of Tailscale's admin console and a tick once the server sees it done: key expiry off for the server and each Messages
// phone, only the owner's devices reaching it, and Tailnet Lock when the tailnet uses it. "Fix it for me" does what the API can with an OAuth client the owner gives
// once (TailscaleAdmin); "Use another Tailscale account" signs the door out and forgets it. Only the signed-in owner sees this, from home, so the sign-in link and the
// owner's login are shown here and nowhere else.

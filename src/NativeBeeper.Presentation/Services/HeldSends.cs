// Undo send at quit (2026-10-04). A message still in its Undo send wait when Messages quits is not sent: it goes back to
// its conversation's saved draft, as Undo would have put it back in the box. Before, quitting sent every held message at
// once, so quitting within the wait was the one way to have no chance to take it back. Every quit path does this first,
// before its drafts are written and its windows closed (MainWindow.ReturnHeldSendsAsync): the tray's Quit and the close
// button through their confirmation, Messages.exe --quit (which the silent uninstaller uses), and the end of a Windows
// session or Setup's Restart Manager through the session flush; App's shutdown asks once more for anything those missed.
// Held sends are text only (a composer's text or reply), so there are never attachments to put back.

/// by the host over the providers' feed rather than once by every client (stage 6, finding 4: with two clients each would ask). It is the window's own
/// <see cref="IncomingMessageUnarchiver"/>, taking what <see cref="IncomingUnarchiveSplit.HostTakes"/> gives the host, in the same queue the window runs it in

/// rest (its merges always); the in-process app and the loopback take all.

/// <para><b>At most once.</b> The watermark is written before anything is asked (as in the window), so a replay of the same arrival, in this run or after a
/// restart, stops at it. The ask itself goes through the host's <see cref="OperationJournal"/> under the arrival's id (the event's, the same id a client uses), like a client's
/// mutation: a repeat answers the first outcome without asking again, and one that was running when the host died is <c>outcome_unknown</c> after the
/// restart, never made again. Nothing here retries.</para>
/// <para><b>Older clients.</b> A client below version 4 still returns groups to the inbox itself, and one below 5 its one-to-one conversations. While one is
/// connected the host leaves those to it (groups below 4, one-to-one conversations below 5), so the two never both ask. What is left open: an older client
/// connected but not running its unarchiver at that moment leaves a conversation archived, two older clients both ask (as before slice 9), and an arrival
/// the host has begun as an older client connects can be asked for by both.</para>
/// <para><b>What the window knew.</b> The provider's archive is the router's to say (<c>chats.settings</c>), as it was for the window. Instagram's "archive
/// on this PC" (<c>chatpref:</c> rows) is never a provider archive and lifts itself when a client reads a newer arrival, so the host reads no preference row.
/// No merge holds a group, so groups need no merges. A one-to-one conversation is the host's only when the shared merges row (slice 5) does not hold it: a
/// merge's archive is that row's, which each client returns itself. A merge made on a client and not yet on the host can meet an arrival as it goes up:
/// the host then returns the conversation on its service and that client its merge, which is one provider ask, not two (the merge is the client's own row).
/// An unmerge not yet on the host is the client's to return (MergedConversations.HostMayHold), so nobody leaves it archived.</para>
/// <para><b>Never holding the feed.</b> Every event goes on to the log at once. The unarchive's own queue drops what does not fit rather than wait (counted in
/// the log), and while the clients take one-to-one conversations, one seen once is never read again for it.</para>

/// <summary>"Remind me about this message": raises one notification for each saved message whose reminder time has come.</summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>A reminder is kept in Saved Messages with its time (<see cref="SavedMessage.RemindAt"/>), so it survives a restart
/// and is seen, and cancelled, in the Saved Messages list. Each one still to come is also handed to Windows for its time
/// (<see cref="ReminderSchedule"/>), so it comes on time while Messages is closed; a running Messages takes it back just
/// before its moment and raises it itself. When Windows cannot hold it (a development copy, notifications not registered), a
/// time that passed while Messages was closed is delivered once at the next start, after the start-up quiet period; nothing
/// is dropped for being late.</para>
/// <para>Nothing here contacts a service or marks anything read: the notification is built from the saved copy. A reminder
/// whose account is not signed in now is left as it is, to be delivered when that account is back, as a snooze is; Windows
/// stops holding it when that service is signed out here, and keeps it while the account is only not known yet.</para>
/// <para><b>On every device</b> (stage 6 slice 8, a client of a server only: <see cref="SavedMessages.IsShared"/>). Each running device raises a reminder for itself, and
/// the first to raise it marks the shared row reminded, which is the row's end state however many do (the marks are the same words, so a second changes nothing
/// the first did not). The mark reaches the other devices as the time going from pending to raised, which would take their pending entry away before their own alarm
/// is due; so an entry that goes that way, raised by another device at the very time it waited for, stays here as an <i>owed</i> one until this device has raised
/// it (its own notification identity makes that at most once, as for any reminder) or the row says otherwise: a time set again, a cancel, an unsave. A device that
/// was not running when it was raised raises nothing for it afterwards. Nothing here sends or marks read anywhere: a reminder is built from the saved copy.</para>

// The server's own administration (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.6), for its owner's Settings → Messages Server → Manage server: what the server is, the accounts it holds,
// and removing one of them from it. Only the owner device is served (as for host.logs and the account move), only on a connection that negotiated
// ProtocolVersion.ServerAdmin, and only by a host that has an IServerAdmin (the Linux server). The status and the list are reads; a removal is a journaled
// mutation, at most once per operation id and never retried by the host. The answers carry fixed words, counts and times, and the list carries the account
// names a client already shows in Settings (never logged on either end). Pairing devices, renaming and revoking them are devices.* (ProtocolMethods.Devices.cs).

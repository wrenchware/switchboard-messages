// Google Voice carries a photo inside the text message, up to 2 MB, as JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP or TIFF (upstream's limits).
// No photo goes with its location (decided, SWITCHBOARD.md "Decisions"). A JPEG, PNG, GIF or BMP that
// already fits goes with its picture untouched and its metadata taken out (PhotoMetadata). Anything larger, a TIFF, a
// file that cannot be read that way, or another image format the platform can read (HEIC, WebP), goes as a JPEG made
// smaller until it fits, which the re-encoder writes with no metadata at all. An animated GIF cannot be made smaller
// without losing the animation, so a GIF over the limit is refused instead.
// What may be sent at all is decided in GoogleVoicePhotos.Rules.cs, which has no Windows types and is checked offline.

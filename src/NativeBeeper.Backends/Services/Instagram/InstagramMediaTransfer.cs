/// The bytes of one file going to the helper and the call that sends them.

/// <remarks>
/// The helper has one staging buffer, reset whenever a chunk arrives at offset zero, and ui.sendMedia sends whatever the
/// buffer holds. Two files in flight at once would therefore interleave: one could be sent holding the other's bytes, to
/// the wrong person. So a transfer takes the turn before its first chunk and gives it back only once the send has been
/// answered or has failed, and no two can overlap. The turn is held through a failure and a cancellation too; the helper
/// runs its calls in order, so whatever a cancelled transfer left queued has run or been dropped by the time the next one's
/// first chunk is answered.

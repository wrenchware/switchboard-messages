// A conversation just deleted here, kept out of the list against the provider's own stale answers for a moment.
//
// Deleting on Google Messages is confirmed by the call, and the phone then echoes the conversation back as it was:
// a "changed" event whose read still returns it, and only half a second later the removal. Applying that echo
// re-added the row, so the user's recording shows the conversation leave, return and leave again. Until the provider
// reports it removed, or the hold runs out, a read that still returns it is not applied. Bounded, so a conversation
// that genuinely comes back — a new message from the same person — is never kept out for long.

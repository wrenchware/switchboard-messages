// What came while nothing was reading Instagram, read before anyone opens it. Instagram announces nothing that arrived
// while the app was closed — a new connection counts everything it can see as already considered — and the list carries
// only a message's words, never its picture, so a reel shared while the app was closed was drawn only when its
// conversation's own read came back: a second after the click, 683 px of reel sliding in (2026-10-02). Reading those
// conversations as the connection starts holds their newest pages (ReadHeldAsync draws them at once) and lets their
// pictures be prepared (CaughtUp). A photo, video or share arriving while the app runs is read whole the same way before
// it is announced. Each read is a request on the real account that nobody asked for by opening anything, so they are few,
// a moment apart and under one hourly ceiling; reading a conversation sends nothing and marks nothing read.

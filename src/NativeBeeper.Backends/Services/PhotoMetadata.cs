// A photo's metadata taken out without touching its picture: the JPEG, PNG, GIF or BMP comes back decoding to the same
// pixels (a JPEG's scans copied byte for byte, a PNG's rows compressed again, a GIF's and BMP's image data cut to what a
// decoder reads), and with nothing that
// says where, when or with what it was taken (EXIF with its GPS block, XMP, IPTC, comments, text chunks, maker blocks,
// embedded thumbnails, and whatever a camera appends after the end of the image, such as a second picture, an HDR gain
// map or a Samsung trailer).
//
// Bytes a decoder never reads count as metadata too, since they travel unseen: a segment, chunk or block longer than its
// contents, zlib data past its stream or past the rows, LZW data past its end code, a colour profile's gaps, a BMP's
// padding and palette reserved bytes. Reviews showed private bytes surviving in such places in files that still decoded.
// What is left unread on purpose: a JPEG scan's entropy-coded data is copied whole, because finding where its last block
// ends means decoding every block; PNG and GIF palette entries no pixel uses (a BMP's are zeroed); and the unused low
// bits at the end of a PNG row under 8 bits a pixel.
// The decision of 2026-10-09 (SWITCHBOARD.md "Decisions") is that a Google Voice photo never carries its
// location; this is how a photo small enough to send as it is keeps its quality and still goes without it.
//
// What is kept is what drawing the picture needs, listed rather than everything except the known metadata, so that a
// block nobody here has heard of is dropped, or the file refused, rather than sent:
// - JPEG: the tables, frames and scans; the JFIF header (with its thumbnail cut off) and Adobe's APP14 (its standard
//   12 bytes), which decide how a decoder reads the colours; and a stock ICC colour profile (PhotoMetadata.Icc.cs).
// - PNG: the critical chunks and the ones that change how it is drawn (transparency, gamma, colour space, a stock
//   profile under a fixed name, background, pixel size, animation). Text, eXIf, time stamps and private chunks go.
// - GIF: the frames, their timing and the loop count. Comments and every other application block (XMP and ICC among
//   them) go.
// - BMP: the file and bitmap headers, masks, palette and pixels, rebuilt without anything between or after them, with the image size
//   and important-colours count rewritten, the masks a BI_RGB V4/V5 header ignores zeroed, and a file whose 16 or 32-bit pixels carry
//   bits no mask covers (other than one empty or full value throughout) re-encoded.
//
// A photo stored turned (EXIF orientation 2 to 8) would show sideways once its EXIF is gone, so it gets a new EXIF block
// holding the orientation and nothing else, always big-endian so even the byte order says nothing about the camera. That
// is one number from 1 to 8 and keeps the picture lossless; turning it through the re-encoder instead would recompress it.
//
// Null means the file is not one this reads to the end with confidence (a broken segment, a marker this does not know,
// an EXIF block whose orientation cannot be found, a colour profile that is not a stock one, a file that is not what its
// type says, TIFF): the caller then re-encodes it, which writes no metadata, rather than sending it as it is.

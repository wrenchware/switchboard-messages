// The accounts move with the PC (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6 slice 13, "accounts move with the PC"; protocol version 16). On moving day Messenger moves as this PC's device
// (its session, the encrypted-device database with its keys, and the retained history) and Instagram as this PC's saved session: no new device is registered and no new
// login is made. Google Messages and Google Voice are never carried; the server signs those in itself. The PC drives, and the server keeps one record per provider,
// sealed with its own key: none -> installing -> installed -> active, and held after a move back. A provider runs on the server only when it is active.
//
//   accounts.move.status       Read. What the server holds of each provider (state, move id, the pieces staged and their digests, how much history, whether it is connected).
//   accounts.move.stage        Journaled. One piece of one provider (the session, the encrypted-device database, the encrypted flag, Instagram's session envelope), handed up
//                              as an upload (media.upload*) and written to a staging place nothing runs from. Its SHA-256 must match what the PC says it sent.
//   accounts.move.history.put  Not journaled: a page of Messenger's retained history (the helper's own export format), by page number. A page the server already holds is
//                              answered again and applied once, so a lost answer is simply asked again.
//   accounts.move.verify       Journaled. The PC says what it sent (digests, history counts); the server compares with what it holds and, when they match, calls the
//                              provider installed.
//   accounts.move.activate     Journaled. All of the named providers at once: their staged pieces are put where the server runs them from, each provider becomes active, and
//                              the server logs each in once. Nothing is activated unless every named provider is installed.
//   accounts.move.abort        Journaled. Throws away what was staged for a move that has not been activated.
//   accounts.move.hold         Journaled. A move back begins: the provider is recorded as held (before anything else) and its helper is closed. A held provider refuses to be
//                              restored, connected, given encryption or signed in, until a new move or an offline clear on the server.
//   accounts.move.read         Read, held only. A piece of a held provider, a chunk at a time, with its SHA-256.
//   accounts.move.history.get  Read, held only. A page of the held Messenger history, by the cursor the page before it gave.
//   accounts.move.release      Journaled. The PC has installed what it took: the server deletes its copies and keeps only the hold.
//   accounts.move.resume       Journaled, from protocol 19. A move back that cannot finish gives the accounts back: an unreleased hold of this move is lifted and the server runs them
//                              again (a device database too new for the PC, found only once its bytes arrived).
//
// Credentials. The session and the envelope are cookies; they cross only the pinned, authenticated connection, as the pieces of an upload, and are never logged, journaled or
// put in a state or an answer. A log line carries a fixed word and counts. The history pages hold message bodies and cross as a request's params; they are never logged.

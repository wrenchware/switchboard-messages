/// <remarks>
/// <para>The helper seals every message, name and attachment field with DPAPI (protection_windows.go; on the Linux server
/// with AES-GCM under its helper key, protection_linux.go), so the store cannot answer a text query itself: LIKE or instr
/// over a sealed cell matches nothing. Each cell is opened here instead, in this process, as the same Windows user (or with
/// the server's key, HelperKeyFileCells), and on Windows that costs about 165 µs a cell on this machine (20,000 in 3.3 s one at a time,
/// 0.8 s four at a time). So the words are indexed in memory once, and each later search reopens only the rows whose
/// sealed bytes changed. Nothing is written anywhere: not to the helper's store, and no plaintext copy on disk. Measured on
/// a synthetic store of 50,000 messages: the first read 2.8-3.2 s (begun when the search dialog opens), a search of an
/// unchanged store under 1 ms, one after the helper wrote a row about 90 ms, and about 36 MB held while the account stays
/// signed in; signing out, or another account, drops it.</para>
/// <para>The store keeps SQLite's rollback journal, where a reader holding its shared lock stops the helper committing
/// and a helper write that waits past its five-second busy timeout loses a message Facebook delivers once. So the store is
/// opened read-only, unpooled, with query_only on, and read in short statements of at most a thousand rows, each finished
/// before the next begins; nothing holds the lock across them or while cells are opened. A store that stays busy for a
/// second is skipped for this search, quietly, and the last index answers. Whether anything changed at all is read from
/// the header's change counter while the shared lock is held, so an unchanged store costs one short statement.</para>
/// <para>Encrypted-device key stores (e2ee.db and the rest) are never opened; only messages.db is. Nothing here reaches
/// Messenger or Facebook, and nothing marks anything read. The diagnostic line carries counts and timings only.</para>

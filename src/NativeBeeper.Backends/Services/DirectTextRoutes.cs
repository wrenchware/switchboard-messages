// from the phone's own number through Google Messages. The person sees a different sender and answers into a
// different conversation, so the app offers the choice instead of deciding it. Which routes actually exist is the
// providers' answer, not a guess here: a route is offered only when its own account says it can start a conversation,
// which keeps a disconnected Voice account or an unpaired phone out of the choice entirely.

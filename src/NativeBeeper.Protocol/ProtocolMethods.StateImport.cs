// Moving a PC's choices onto a Messages Server (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6 slice 13; protocol version 11). The PC reads its own stores (a MoveBundle), hands the bundle
// up like a file (media.upload*, so it is encrypted at rest on the host and never a frame of its own), and asks for it to be taken in once:
//
//   state.import   Journaled by its operation id (the move's id), so a repeat of that id answers the first answer. Takes the bundle's rows into the shared
//                  state, adding where the space holds nothing for a key and never replacing, so a second move, with another id, adds nothing it has not already
//                  got. A space with no key yet is filed under the bundle's key (the PC's, adopted verbatim, so no row is renamed); a space already filed under
//                  another key answers `space_mismatch` and keeps nothing. The answer counts what happened and says what the server now holds of the bundle's
//                  keys (per kind, and a digest), for the PC to compare with what it sent.
//
// The answer carries counts and a digest of keys only: the journal keeps it, and nothing a person wrote may be in it.

namespace NativeBeeper.Protocol;

// A Google sign-in made in the server's own browser (SWITCHBOARD.md 5.4, chosen 2026-10-10; protocol version 12). Google binds a sign-in to the browser that made it,
// so a server that must renew one has to be the browser that signs in. The client shows that browser in a window:
//
//   accounts.google.remoteSignIn       A journaled mutation like accounts.google.signIn, and it ends as that one does (the pairing emoji as progress, then Done). The host
//                                      starts a browser of its own on a virtual display, sends what it shows as `signInView` events to this connection only, and, when the
//                                      sign-in is finished, reads the cookies from that browser, keeps its profile for renewals and pairs the phone. One at a time; ended
//                                      by the call's own cancel, by the connection closing, or by the host's idle (10 minutes) and total (20 minutes) limits.
//   accounts.google.remoteSignInInput  Not a mutation and never journaled: what the person did in the window (pointer, keys, typed text, size). Answered Done; refused
//                                      unless this connection has a sign-in under way.
//
// What the person types may be a password. So: an input event is never logged, journaled, kept in the event log or written to a file, by either end; a frame (a picture
// of Google's page, which may show an address or a code) the same. The events carry no identifier a log could show, an error names no part of them, and the types that
// hold them print only their own name.
//
// Protocol 15 adds the same for Google Voice:
//
//   accounts.voice.remoteSignIn        As accounts.google.remoteSignIn, for a Voice account: the host's Chrome is started on a new Chrome profile of that account's own and, when the
//                                      person is signed in to Voice, the host reads the cookies, adds the account (the profile is kept for its renewals) and answers Done. No emoji
//                                      are sent. What the browser shows is `signInView`, and what the person does goes by accounts.google.remoteSignInInput: one window, one at a time.
//
// Protocol 27 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 10, 10.5) makes it one method for any service:
//
//   accounts.remoteSignIn              {service: google|voice|messenger|instagram}. Google and Voice run as their own methods above do. Messenger and Instagram sign in in the server's Chrome
//                                      on a throwaway profile at the service's login page; the person says when they are finished with a `done` input (RemoteSignIn.DoneKind) through the same
//                                      input method; the host closes that Chrome so its cookie file is whole, reads the cookies the PC's own window would have kept, deletes the profile and
//                                      connects the account as accounts.<service>.connect does (Messenger then turns its encrypted conversations on, once). The answer is a
//                                      RemoteSignInResult: the conversations that joined and, for Messenger, how the encrypted step went. A failure is a fixed word, as the connect's own.
//                                      Nothing is retried: a sign-in that failed is started again by the person.

// never got there. "running" is a crash, a fail-fast, Task Manager or the forced stop before an install: no shutdown ran
// to the end. "session" is Windows ending the session (a restart, a sign-out, the installer's close) after Messages
// had agreed to it and while its bounded close was still under way, so that close did not finish in time.
//
// Beside it, "<marker>.version" names the build that wrote it. The marker's own text stays exactly "running" or
// "session" (tools\Probe-SessionEnd.ps1 reads it), so the build has a file of its own.
//
// No WinUI types, so the contract harness links this file. Every call is guarded: a marker that cannot be written
// leaves the next launch saying "unknown" or "clean", never stops this one.

namespace NativeBeeper.Protocol;

// Scheduled sends on the server (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6 slice 11, docs/research/switchboard-stage6.md S1-S9; protocol version 9). A server's host holds the
// schedule and fires it itself, so a message goes at its time with every client closed, and goes once however many clients are looking at it. Its clients draw
// the rows (`scheduled:<H(profile, id)>`, a SharedCategories category only the host writes) from their replica and change them only through these four
// journaled methods; none of them ever queues offline, so a client that is not connected is refused as a send is.
//
//   scheduled.create   Keeps a text for a time. The row's id is made from the client's operation id, so a lost answer is looked for in the replica, and the
//                      same operation answers the same row.
//   scheduled.edit     Takes a row back for the composer: it is no longer scheduled, and its words come back in the answer.
//   scheduled.cancel   Removes a row that has not started sending.
//   scheduled.sendNow  Asks a waiting or not-sent row to go now; it goes through the same checks as one whose time came.
//
// Each command on an existing row carries the rev of the row its client drew (`ifRev`); the host runs the commands on one row one at a time, so of two clients
// that act on the same row at once the second finds the row changed and is answered `conflict`, which is no failure (it redraws from its replica). A row that
// has started sending answers `already_sending` to edit, cancel and sendNow: the message is on its way and nothing can take it back. All of this is in the
// answer, not in an error, so the journal keeps it with the operation and a repeat answers the same. A real failure (not connected, the host cannot keep it)
// is an ordinary error.
//
// What a message does at the provider is not here: the host sends it through its OperationJournal under the fixed id `sched:<id>:<attempt>`, with the attempt
// written in the row before the provider is asked, so no command, restart or second client can send the same attempt twice.

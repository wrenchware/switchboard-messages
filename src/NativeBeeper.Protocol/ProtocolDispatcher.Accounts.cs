// sessions. A mutation (connect, sign-in, restore, sign out, encryption on, reset, history indexing, forgetting avatars) is journaled
// like a send: at most once per client operation id, an interrupted one an unknown outcome, never retried. An account action's answer
// follows the state it caused (SettleAsync), and a sign-in's progress reaches only the connection that made the call.
//
// Credentials. The cookies of a sign-in and the pairing result are parameters of that one mutation. Nothing here writes a parameter
// anywhere: the journal keeps a hash (OperationJournal.Fingerprint) and the answer, the answer carries a count or a snapshot, an
// error carries a fixed sentence or a fixed code word (AccountFailure), and the only log lines of an account call are the shared
// "protocol journal ..." vocabulary and a refusal to a device that is not the owner (OwnerOnly), which names the method and nothing else.

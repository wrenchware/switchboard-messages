// The server's own backup (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 10, step 10.2; protocol 26): one encrypted file a day into a folder the server's host maps, with the server's
// data and identity and never a service's sign-in. Any device may read how it stands (`server.backup.status`), so a PC can show it in Settings and a phone can
// tell nobody has backed up lately; only the owner device starts one or sets its password. Neither of those is journaled: a second Back up now while one runs
// is answered busy, and setting the password twice sets it twice. A password is never logged on either end and is never in a journal (a mutation's journal keeps
// a digest of its params). The `backup` account signal (AccountSignals.Backup) tells a connection of 26 or later that the status changed.

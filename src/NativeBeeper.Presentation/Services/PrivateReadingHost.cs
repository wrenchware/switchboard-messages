/// The host's end of private reading's explicit admission (SWITCHBOARD.md 2.6d). A client's <see cref="PrivateReadingGate"/> decides
/// whether a read marker or a typing start may go to a service; the request reaches the host on a task of its own, where the gate's
/// <c>AsyncLocal</c> is not set. This wraps the host's real read-state writer: a read the client says the person asked for by name
/// (<c>explicit</c>) runs inside the gate's admitted scope, so the router's own refusal (<see cref="PrivateReadingGate.Refuses"/>) lets it
/// through; every other read runs as it is, and the router refuses it for a conversation the host reads privately, exactly as it does in one
/// process.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Trust boundary.</b> What the host trusts its authenticated client for is the one thing only the person can say: that this read was
/// asked for by name (a notification's Mark read, Send read receipt, the console's /read). <c>admitted</c> alone is not enough. It says only
/// that the client's gate, by the client's own view of the choice, did not withhold the read, and that view can be behind: private reading is one
/// setting for every device (decision D4, SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6), so another device can have turned it on while this client has not heard.
/// An automatic read from that client must not reach the service, so the host decides it by its own view (<c>HostClientState</c>: the most
/// private of what its connected clients state), which is what the routers behind this read. A client that sends only <c>admitted</c> (one
/// from before <c>explicit</c>) is therefore treated as automatic; the worst that costs is a receipt asked for by name from such a client,
/// withheld for a conversation the host reads privately.</para>
/// <para>A host with no <c>HostClientState</c> has routers with no private reading of their own, and then nothing here refuses a read; the
/// client's gate is the only enforcement, as before. A client that sends <c>explicit: true</c> for a conversation the user reads privately can
/// still make the host tell the service; that is the person's authenticated client acting as the person (stage 3).</para>

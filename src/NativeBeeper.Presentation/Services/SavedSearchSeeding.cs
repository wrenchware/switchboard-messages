/// Puts the saved copies of recent Instagram and Google Voice conversations into the search catalogue, so search finds
/// their messages after a restart before each conversation is opened again. Those services have no history of their own
/// on this PC to search (Google's archive and Messenger's helper store answer for theirs), and the catalogue held only
/// what this session had read: everything in them was unfindable until opened (2026-10-02).
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Only conversations the list shows, newest first, a bounded number per service connection, and only copies already
/// saved here: nothing is asked of any service. Reading a copy decrypts it, and the store has one gate that an opening
/// conversation's own saved copy waits on, so nothing is read in the launch's first seconds, one copy at a time, a moment
/// apart. A reconnect clears its service's rows from the catalogue, and its copies go in again after it.

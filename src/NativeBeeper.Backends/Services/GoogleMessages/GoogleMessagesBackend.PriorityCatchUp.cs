// since both pause while the app is in use). Seen 2026-10-02: a conversation opened 7 s after launch still drew those
// messages only when the phone answered. Each conversation's newest pages are read until they reach where the archive's
// last catch-up ended, as the crawl does, but through the same page an opening reads, so the helper can fetch their photos
// and make their link cards, and they are held in memory: from then on the conversation can be drawn from what is held
// (ReadHeldAsync) without waiting for the archive. Bounded (PriorityChats × PriorityPages, under the helper's 5,000 kept
// messages), and every call is skipIfBusy, so it never holds up anything the user opens.

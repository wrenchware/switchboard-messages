/// <remarks>
/// <para>Each snooze still to come is also handed to Windows for its moment (<see cref="ReminderSchedule"/>), so its reminder
/// comes on time while Messages is closed; a running Messages takes it back just before the moment and raises its own, which
/// knows whether anything is still unread. Where Windows cannot hold it, a moment that passed while the app was closed is
/// still delivered at the next start rather than dropped: the point of snoozing is to be told later, and later has already
/// arrived. Nothing here sends, reads or otherwise touches an account; a reminder is a local notification about messages
/// already received.</para>
/// <para>What Windows is handed is built from this PC's own copy of each conversation (<paramref name="localChat"/>: the
/// chat list as last shown), never by asking a service. Scheduling runs again on every snooze, Notification options change,
/// Pause, notifications on or off and sign-out; asking a service each time would be a read per snooze per change, and on
/// Instagram a live request whose limits are undocumented. A conversation this PC has not shown yet keeps what Windows
/// already holds for it, as an account not known yet does. Only the reminder itself, raised by the running app at its
/// moment, reads the conversation, once, to know what is unread.</para>

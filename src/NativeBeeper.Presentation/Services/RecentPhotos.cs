/// <remarks>
/// <para>Rows come only from what this PC already holds: the copies kept in memory and on disk for conversations opened
/// before, and the list's own last message. Nothing asks a service for history to find a photo, nothing opens a
/// conversation, and nothing marks one read; the only request is each picture's own download, through the same read a
/// conversation draws it with (the caller's <c>prepare</c>), which puts it in the media cache for next time.</para>
/// <para>Bounded every way: <see cref="Limits.Conversations"/> conversations, <see cref="Limits.PerConversation"/> photos
/// each, <see cref="Limits.Budget"/> bytes downloaded in all for the launch, one at a time with a pause after each
/// download, and each attempt given up after <see cref="Limits.Attempt"/>. A picture is tried once per launch whatever
/// happened. On a fresh install the first pass finds little (no copies kept yet), so two more passes follow, a few minutes
/// apart, while fewer conversations than asked for had any rows; the budget is shared by all three.</para>
/// <para>The caller leaves out what must not be fetched in the background at all (skip): Instagram, whose every request is
/// the user's real account and whose background budget is already spent on catch-up reads.</para>

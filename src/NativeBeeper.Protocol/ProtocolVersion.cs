/// <remarks>
/// 2 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6, slice 1) adds the shared state: <c>state.sync</c>, <c>state.get</c>, <c>state.put</c> and the <c>shared</c> event. It is
/// additive: a version 2 host still serves a version 1 client, which never asks for them and ignores the event kind it does not know, and a version 2
/// client of a version 1 host keeps its shared rows to itself.
/// <para>3 (stage 6, slice 3) adds four shared categories (<see cref="SharedCategories"/>): the chat preferences (<c>chatpref:</c>), the names kept for
/// people (<c>name:</c>), the snoozes (<c>snooze:</c>) and the pinned order. No method changes: a version 2 peer is simply never given those rows, a version 2
/// client keeps its own files and asks <c>snoozes.*</c> as before, and a version 3 client of a version 2 host stays on its files as it was.</para>
/// <para>4 (stage 6, slice 9) changes who returns an archived conversation to the inbox when a message arrives in it: a server's host does it for group
/// conversations, once for all its clients, and a client connected at 4 leaves those to it. No frame and no shared category changes; what moves is a duty,
/// so both sides go by the version: a client below 4, or of a host below 4, does all of it itself as before, and a host leaves it to such a client while one
/// is connected.</para>
/// <para>5 (stage 6, slice 5) adds the merges (<c>merges:</c>) and the labels (<c>labels:</c>), each one row written by compare-and-set
/// (<see cref="SharedConflictPolicy.CompareAndSet"/>), and gives the host the archived one-to-one conversations outside every merge as well, now that it can
/// read the merges: a client connected at 5 leaves those to it too. A peer of 4 is never given those rows and keeps its merges and labels to itself, and a
/// host leaves one-to-one conversations to its clients while any connection below 5 is open, as it leaves groups to them below 4.</para>
/// <para>6 (stage 6, slice 6) adds the drafts (<c>draft:</c>) and the rows noting who owns them (<c>draft-owner:</c>), each a chat's own row, last writer wins
/// (the words kept for no account yet, <c>draft-unfiled:</c>, stay on the device). No method changes: a peer of 5 is never given those rows and keeps its drafts
/// on its own device, and a client of 6 of a host of 5 does the same.</para>
/// <para>7 (stage 6, slice 7) adds the read-here marks (<c>preferences:</c> row <c>read-here</c>, one row written by compare-and-set) and the private reading
/// choice (one row a service, each last writer wins). A peer below 7 is never given them and keeps both to itself: its marks in its state, its choice in
/// <c>app-preferences.json</c>, exactly as before. No method changes.</para>
/// <para>8 (stage 6, slice 8) adds the saved messages with their reminder times (<c>saved:</c>, a message one row, saved by a create-only write and deleted when unsaved)
/// and the custom avatars (<c>avatar-v2:</c>, last writer wins; a value over 64 KiB is read with <c>state.get</c>). No method changes: a peer below 8 is never given those
/// rows and keeps both on its own device. A server of 8 also keeps the originals of the saved messages' photos itself, and serves them through <c>media.read</c> to
/// whichever device opens one, so a client connected at 8 keeps none of its own; one below 8 does as before.</para>
/// <para>9 (stage 6, slice 11) moves the firing of scheduled sends to the server (owner D6): a server's host runs them itself, even with every client closed,
/// and its clients draw them from rows (<c>scheduled:</c>, written by the host alone, <see cref="SharedCategory.HostOwned"/>) and ask it for the four typed,
/// journaled commands <c>scheduled.create</c>, <c>edit</c>, <c>cancel</c> and <c>sendNow</c>. A send of unknown outcome or failed on the server is a host-owned
/// row too (<c>outbox:</c>), drawn by every client as "may not have sent", and <c>outbox.dismiss</c> removes it everywhere.
/// A client below 9, or of a host below 9, keeps its own schedule and fires it itself as before; a client of 9 or later never fires one itself, which is
/// what keeps one message from being sent by both (S2, S3).</para>
/// <para>10 (stage 6 review) gives <c>scheduled.cancel</c> and <c>scheduled.edit</c> with <c>IfRev</c> 0 a meaning: discard a message the client never saw the row of (its
/// stand-in for a create of unknown outcome). The host takes the message away if it made it and otherwise closes its id for good, so that the create can never make it. A client
/// of 10 does not send it to a host below 10 (it keeps the stand-in and says so). A client below 10 of a host of 10 still answers a stand-in's cancel by asking the create again and
/// then cancelling, which a create arriving just before its time and a cancel just after can turn into a send; that stays until such a client is updated.</para>
/// <para>11 (stage 6, slice 13) adds <c>state.import</c>, the one method that moves a PC's choices onto a server (a journaled mutation that takes a bundle of
/// shared rows, handed up like a file, into the shared state, adding and never replacing). No category and no frame changes: a client below 11 never calls it, and
/// a host answers it as not supported to a connection that negotiated less.</para>
/// <para>12 (SWITCHBOARD.md 5.4) adds <c>accounts.google.remoteSignIn</c> and <c>accounts.google.remoteSignInInput</c> and the <c>signInView</c> event: a Google sign-in made in the
/// server's own browser, shown in the client's window (<see cref="HostLimits.RemoteGoogleSignIn"/> says whether a host offers it). Additive: a client below 12 never calls them, a host
/// answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less, and a client of 12 of a host below 12 (or one that does not say it offers it) signs in as before.</para>
/// <para>13 (SWITCHBOARD.md 5.4) adds <c>accounts.google.qrPairing</c> and <c>accounts.google.qrPairingCancel</c> and the <c>qrCode</c> event: Google Messages paired by QR code, the phone scanning a code
/// the host shows (<see cref="HostLimits.QrPairing"/> says whether a host offers it). Additive in the same way as 12: a client below 13 never calls them, a host answers them as not
/// supported to a connection that negotiated less, and a client of 13 of a host below 13 (or one that does not say it offers it) pairs as before.</para>
/// <para>14 (SWITCHBOARD.md 5.4, Chrome on the server) adds <see cref="HostLimits.ChromeOutOfDate"/>: the server's own Chrome has gone unrenewed past the age the image was meant to keep it. The
/// sign-in window, its methods and the <c>signInView</c> event are as at 12; what the pictures show is now the server's whole virtual display (the page's size in <c>ViewWidth</c> by
/// <c>ViewHeight</c> is that display's, and pointer positions are pixels of it). Additive: a client below 14 ignores the member, and a host below 14 never sets it.</para>
/// <para>15 (SWITCHBOARD.md 5.4, Google Voice on the server) adds <c>accounts.voice.remoteSignIn</c> and <see cref="HostLimits.RemoteVoiceSignIn"/>: a Google Voice sign-in made by hand in the server's own Chrome, on a
/// Chrome profile of that Voice account's own, shown in the same window and driven by the same <c>accounts.google.remoteSignInInput</c> and <c>signInView</c> as Google Messages'. Additive: a client below 15 never calls
/// it, a host answers it as not supported to a connection that negotiated less, and a client of 15 of a host below 15 (or one that does not say it offers it) signs Voice in as before, or is told the server does not run it.
/// A server that offers it refuses the cookie hand-over <c>accounts.voice.add</c> from a client (<c>sign_in_use_server</c>): cookies copied from a PC are refused by Google at two hours.</para>
/// <para>16 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6 slice 13, accounts move with the PC) adds <c>accounts.move.*</c> (<see cref="ProtocolMethods.AccountMoveStatus"/> and nine more): Messenger moves as the PC's
/// device (session, encrypted-device database, retained history) and Instagram as the PC's session, over the same connection, staged on the server before anything runs and
/// activated together; a move back holds the accounts and takes them home. A held server answers an old client's account calls with the word <c>account_moved_away</c>. It also adds
/// <c>MessengerEncryption.DeviceMissing</c> to the state a client reads (the encrypted-device keys of a restore are gone and nothing was registered). Additive for the methods: a client below 16 never
/// calls them and a host answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less. A host never publishes the new enum word to a connection below 16 (an older client would not be able to read the frame): it
/// sends <c>Down</c> there instead.</para>
/// <para>17 (stage 6 slice 13, the third review) adds the Instagram piece <see cref="MovePieces.Guard"/>: the account's limits travel with its session both ways, so a move is no way round the hour of
/// background reads, and an account check the server was held for comes home with the account. A client of 17 moves Instagram only to a host of 17 (a host below 17 would refuse the piece); a move
/// back from a host below 17 finds no guard there and keeps this PC's own.</para>
/// <para>18 adds <c>host.logs</c> (<see cref="ProtocolMethods.HostLogsRead"/>): the server's own logs, a chunk at a time, by a name from a fixed list (<see cref="HostLogNames"/>, never a
/// path) and only to the owner device, so the owner's Messages keeps copies of them and nobody needs a shell on the server to read them. Additive: a client below 18 never calls it, a host
/// answers it as not supported to a connection that negotiated less (or when it has no logs to give), and a client of 18 asks only a host of 18.</para>
/// <para>19 (stage 6 slice 13, 2026-10-12) guards a move back against a device database the PC cannot read, now that the server updates itself nightly and the PC only when released: a host
/// reports in <see cref="AccountMoveProvider.DeviceSchema"/> the schema version recorded in the Messenger device database it would hand back (whatsmeow's own <c>whatsmeow_version</c>) and in
/// <see cref="AccountMoveProvider.SessionVersion"/> the format of Instagram's saved session envelope, and adds
/// <c>accounts.move.resume</c> (<see cref="ProtocolMethods.AccountMoveResume"/>), which lifts a hold that was not released and runs the account on the server again, for a move back whose downloaded
/// bytes turned out too new after all. Additive: a host below 19 reports no schema, which a client reads as compatible (it was built before this
/// client, and the bytes are checked again once they arrive), and is never asked to resume; a client below 19 asks neither.</para>
/// <para>20 (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.6) adds the server's administration for its owner device: <c>host.status</c>, <c>host.accounts</c> and <c>host.removeAccount</c> (<see cref="ProtocolMethods.HostStatusRead"/>),
/// and <c>devices.rename</c>. Additive: a client below 20 never calls them, a host answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less, and a client of 20 asks only a
/// host of 20. It also writes the support window down (<see cref="Supported"/>), which changes nothing on the wire.</para>
/// <para>21 (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.6, ask to join) lets a new device ask to join with nothing but the server's address: it connects without a token on a join connection
/// (<see cref="NetworkPairing.JoinHeader"/>), the server holds its request, and the owner approves it on the server's page or with <c>devices.joinRequests</c>,
/// <c>devices.approveJoin</c> and <c>devices.denyJoin</c> after matching a short code both ends work out (<see cref="JoinMatch"/>). Additive: a client below 21 never
/// calls them and pairs with a code as before, a host answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less, and an older host refuses a join connection at
/// its door, which a client of 21 reads as "use a pairing code".</para>
/// <para>22 (2026-10-14, after an adversarial review) adds the finish code to asking to join: an approval to a join connection of 22 makes a code shown only on the owner's
/// screen (<c>devices.approveJoin</c> answers it in <see cref="JoinApproved.FinishCode"/>; the page shows it), the wait answers its proof (<see cref="PairJoinApproved"/>)
/// instead of the token, and the device asks for its token with <c>pair.joinFinish</c> (<see cref="NetworkPairing.JoinFinishMethod"/>) once its person typed a code that
/// gives the proof (<see cref="JoinMatch.FinishProof"/>); the device is added only then. Additive for the server: a join connection of 21 is answered as before. Not for
/// the device: a device of 22 asks only a server of 22, since anything answering at the address could otherwise say it is older and skip the proof.</para>
/// <para>24 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 8) adds the server's whole copy of every conversation: <c>history.sync</c>, <c>history.older</c> and <c>history.changes</c>, and the
/// <c>history</c> event, which carries the changed messages themselves. Additive: a client below 24 never calls them and is never sent the event (its place in the sequence
/// counts as sent), and a host answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less. What every version gains is that the server answers its existing reads
/// (<c>messages.page</c>, <c>history.held</c>, <c>messages.resolve</c>, the peeks) from the same copy where it holds the conversation, with page cursors of its own.</para>
/// <para>25 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 9) adds one ordered feed of the server's list rows and messages together (<c>history.feed</c>), a client's check of its copies against
/// the server's (<c>history.verify</c>), the server's check of its own copy against the services (<c>history.mirror</c>), and the <c>row</c> event (a list row the
/// server built again by itself). Additive: a client below 25 never calls them and is never sent the event, and a host answers them as not supported to a
/// connection that negotiated less. What every version gains is a list row whose last message is the server's copy's, so
/// the list never says what the thread does not hold.</para>
/// <para>26 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 10, 10.2) adds the server's own backup: <c>server.backup.status</c> to any device, <c>server.backup.run</c> and
/// <c>server.backup.password</c> to the owner device, and the <c>backup</c> account signal (<see cref="AccountSignals.Backup"/>). Additive: a client below 26 never
/// calls them and is never sent the signal (its place in the sequence counts as sent), and a host answers them as not supported to a connection that negotiated less.
/// A restore (10.3) changes nothing on the wire: every copy a client holds starts over through the new epochs it already reads.</para>
/// <para>27 (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 10, 10.5) adds <c>accounts.remoteSignIn</c>: one method for a sign-in in the server's own browser, for any service it names (<see cref="RemoteSignInServices"/>), with
/// the <c>signInView</c> event and the input method of 12 and one new input kind, <see cref="RemoteSignIn.DoneKind"/>, by which the person says a Messenger or Instagram sign-in is finished. It adds
/// <see cref="HostLimits.RemoteMessengerSignIn"/> and <see cref="HostLimits.RemoteInstagramSignIn"/>. Additive: a client below 27 never calls it and keeps the methods of 12 and 15, which stay; a host
/// answers it as not supported to a connection that negotiated less; a client of 27 of a host below 27 (or one that does not say it offers a service) signs that service in as before.</para>

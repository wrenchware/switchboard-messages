// Finding somebody to write to, and opening the conversation with them.
//
// Instagram has no call that creates an empty conversation. What it has is a route lookup, FetchThreadID, that
// answers with the thread two accounts already share, and that thread exists before either side has said anything.
// So starting a chat here is a lookup rather than a creation: the conversation is opened, never invented, and it
// arrives carrying Instagram's own two ids the same way every other conversation in this helper does.
//
// The other path upstream keeps is a send addressed to recipient_igids with no thread id, which brings the thread
// into being as a side effect of the first message. It is deliberately not taken here, for two reasons. It would
// hand the app a conversation with no Instagram id to name it by, and conversation ids here are Instagram's own, so
// there would be nothing to call it until the message landed. And upstream's own note on that field asks whether it
// should carry Instagram ids rather than messaging ids — the two-id confusion stage 3 went looking for — which is
// not a question to answer by guessing against somebody's account. A lookup that finds no thread says so.

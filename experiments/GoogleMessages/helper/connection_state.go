// What the library says about the pairing and the phone, passed on to the app as fixed codes; never the library's
// error text. Upstream (pkg/connector/handlegmessages.go) reads the same events: a pairing the phone revoked, a ping
// Google answers "not found" mean the saved pairing is dead, and only pairing again brings the account back. A poll
// Google rejects as unauthenticated, or its "invalid credentials", is not that: upstream drops only the Google-account
// cookies there and keeps the pairing (invalidateSession(…, false, true)), because it is the sign-in that expired. The
// helper said pairing_lost for it until 0.1.285, and on 2026-09-23 that told the user to pair again while the phone
// still listed this computer, and hid the renewal that fixes it. The phone's own silence, and its saying this computer
// is inactive, are only states.
//
// Google's logout marker is reported apart, as logged_out, and is not treated as proof here: a maintainer reports that
// Google pushes it when the phone's registration rotates, roughly daily (mautrix/gmessages#73), and before upstream's
// c1b622f a failed pairing's marker could be replayed to a later session (#52). The app reconnects on it, and only a
// second marker, or one of the signals above, makes it say the pairing is gone.
//
// Before this the helper dropped every one of them. A pairing removed on the phone reached the app as requests that
// never answered, and it retried each for a minute at a time, for as long as it ran.

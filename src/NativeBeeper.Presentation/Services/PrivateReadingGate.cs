/// <item>A typing start for such a conversation is not sent. A stop always is: one only follows a start, and a start sent
/// just before the switch was turned on must not leave the other person watching dots.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Explicit"/> is the writer for what the user asked for by name (a notification's Mark read, the
/// conversation menu's Send read receipt, the console's /read). It always tells the service.</item>
/// </list>
/// Whatever passes is marked as admitted for the length of the call, and the routers that talk to the providers refuse
/// a private-reading conversation's read or typing that arrives unadmitted (<see cref="Refuses"/>): a path that reached a

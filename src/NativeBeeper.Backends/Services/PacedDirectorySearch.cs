/// The rules for searching Messenger's or Instagram's directory (<see cref="RemoteSearchRules"/>), kept where the search is answered. They were the client's
/// alone: three characters, a pause before asking, 900 ms between calls, answers remembered for five minutes. A client that is not this app's window (a
/// device paired with a server) is not bound by the window's code, and each call is a real request on the user's own account, with Instagram's limits
/// unknown and a checkpoint the price of being throttled. So the backend holds them whoever asks, and the window's own pacing never trips them.

/// A query under the minimum is answered empty without a call. A query asked within five minutes is answered from memory. A call comes at least
/// <see cref="RemoteSearchRules.PerProvider"/> after the last; a search that arrives early waits its turn rather than being dropped, but only one waits
/// at a time, so a flood is refused (rate limited, transient) instead of queued.

// Photo bytes/decode may be fetched, but message lookup stays local: no thread opening, history paging or read marks.
// One worker leaves the other visible-image download slots free. Old reconnect history is not a prefetch backlog, except
// what a provider's catch-up names: the messages that came while the app was closed, in the few conversations it caught
// up (OfferCaughtUp). A shared reel or post is prepared as a photo is: its card's picture is the tallest thing in its
// conversation, and it was the one left to arrive after the conversation had opened (2026-10-02). Stickers and the still
// drawn for a video are pictures like any other; a GIF clip's bytes are kept ahead on disk (prepareClip), bounded by the
// caller, never decoded here and never a whole video.
//
// wantsCard decides, per provider, which messages are worth asking a card for (by default only a Facebook or Instagram
// share, which is what Messenger's encrypted conversations need); requestCard is where the provider's own rules about
// whose links may be fetched are applied. hasStill says whether a video's SourceUrl names a still its provider can draw.

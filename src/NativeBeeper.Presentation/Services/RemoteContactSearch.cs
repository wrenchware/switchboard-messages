/// Messenger and Instagram answer a search over the network, so every keystroke that reaches them is a real API call
/// against the user's own account. Searching all services at once multiplies that by however many are connected, and
/// Instagram's limits are not documented anywhere this project can check — being throttled there risks a checkpoint
/// on a real account, which is a far worse outcome than a picker that waits a moment. So remote searches are rare by
/// construction: only for a query long enough to mean something, only once typing has actually stopped, never twice
/// for the same words, and never more than one at a time per provider.

// A helper started by the Linux server ends with it however the server ends, a crash or a SIGKILL included, rather than
// staying logged in to the real account beside the next server's helper: two clients on one Instagram session is the
// kind of traffic that gets an account checked (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.2). End of input says the same, but a helper inside a
// call reads its input only between frames, and a mutation runs to its end whatever happens to the pipe (dispatch.go).
// The server names itself in MESSAGES_HELPER_PARENT_PID; without it (tests, a helper started by hand) nothing here
// applies. The same watch as the Messenger helper's (experiments/Messenger/helper/parentwatch_linux.go).
//
// This is the helper's only Linux piece. It keeps nothing on disk: the session it hands back is sealed by the host
// (InstagramSessionStore under the host's key), so it needs no key file or private folder of its own.

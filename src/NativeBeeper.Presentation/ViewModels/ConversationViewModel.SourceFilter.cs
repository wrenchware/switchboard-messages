// which loaded rows are drawn. Paging, the sending route, drafts and the read rule are those of the whole conversation —
// the route is still worked out from every service's messages — and "reaching the bottom acknowledges displayed history"
// then acknowledges only what is displayed, never a hidden service's rows. It ends when the conversation is left or
// opened again, and when this conversation's own composer sends through a service it hides, so the message just sent is
// never out of sight.
//
// Choosing a service reads nothing. Earlier history is read only when asked for — scrolling up, or the list's own "Load
// earlier messages" — because a combined page reads every member's history, Instagram's included, and Instagram's limits
// are undocumented with a checkpoint on the real account as the price of finding them.

// Editing a sent message in the composer, as Messenger, Slack and Teams do: Up in an empty composer or Edit on a message
// puts that message's text in the box, and Enter saves it through the message actions' one edit call. Whatever the box
// held before (text and a chosen reply) is set aside and comes back when the edit ends, however it ends: saved,
// cancelled, or the composer switching to another conversation. While editing, the box's words are the edit, never the
// draft: the saved draft on disk stays what it was, and nothing in the box is sent, scheduled or used as a caption.
//
// The edit goes to the conversation that owns the message (its own ChatId), which in a combined conversation need not be
// the composer's sending route. Only one edit call is ever made per Enter; a rejected one keeps the editing state so the
// words can be fixed, and one whose outcome is unknown ends it (the message actions refuse another change to that message
// and keep the words for this session, so nothing is resent).

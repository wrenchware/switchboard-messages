// is from this morning or from March, and the only way to find out is to open one. Dates are the landmark people
// already have for their own photographs, so the grid carries the same headings a phone's camera roll does.
//
// Recent days get their own names because that is how they are spoken about; everything past this month is named by
// its month, and past this year by its month and year, because "August" alone stops meaning one month once there
// have been two of them. A pure function of the photo's time and the current time, so every boundary is read back by
// a check rather than waited for.

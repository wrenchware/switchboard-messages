// The shared state (SWITCHBOARD.md stage 6, docs/research/switchboard-stage6.md; protocol version 2): one replicated key–value space per host, holding
// the user's choices that must look the same on every device. The host keeps the one authoritative copy (SharedStateStore, <root>\Server\shared.db);
// each client keeps a replica it draws from and writes into, and sends its writes on behind it (ReplicatedStateStore).
//
//   state.sync  read     What changed since a position {epoch, rev}, a page at a time; from nowhere, another epoch or below the horizon it is a snapshot
//                        (reset). A page holds at most SharedLimits.PageRows rows and SharedLimits.PageBytes of values; a value over
//                        SharedLimits.InlineBytes, or past the page's budget, comes as its size only and is read with state.get.
//   state.get   read     The current rows of some keys, for the values that came as a size only.
//   state.put   write    Writes, each a value or a delete (null), in one commit with one rev. Deduped by clientOpId in the host's own `applied` table, not
//                        the OperationJournal: these writes come every few seconds and would push the sends' entries out, and retrying one is safe (it
//                        is not a provider mutation). So it is not a catalogue mutation, and its params do not derive from MutationParams.
//   event `shared`        Each commit, in the host's event sequence, so a client that resumes is given what it missed; a resync makes it call state.sync.
//
// Keys keep the formats the client's state.db already uses (`<category>:<digest>`), and only the keys SharedCategories names may be stored: any other
// write is answered `refused` and never stored, so a per-device row (cache:, draft-unfiled:, emoji recents) can never leave the client.
// The set of categories grows only with the protocol version (SharedCategory.Since): a host gives a connection only the rows of the categories its
// negotiated version knows (and no `shared` event at all below version 2), and a client keeps only the rows it would share itself, so a row an older
// client does not know (scheduled:, outbox:, draft:, later) can never reach or replace one of its own.
// Values are the rows' own JSON. They are never logged; at rest the host seals them with its IStateProtector.

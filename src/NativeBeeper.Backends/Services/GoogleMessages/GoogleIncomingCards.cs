// Whether a link that came in a Google Messages conversation may have its card made as it arrives, before anyone opens
// the conversation. Making a card fetches the linked page (the helper does it anonymously, ui.linkPreviews), and the
// conversation on screen has always done that for what it shows; asked ahead of time it is a fetch nobody chose, so it is
// asked only where opening the conversation would plainly have led to it:
// - never with link previews turned off (Settings), which is the user saying no page is to be fetched for them;
// - never in a conversation the list does not show this session or files as spam, nor one Google keeps hidden;
// - never from a short code or a named sender (an alphanumeric id): bulk senders' links are what a person least wants
//   fetched on their behalf, and the fetch itself tells the sender's site the link was looked at;
// - only from someone the user knows: in a one-to-one conversation a contact saved on the phone (Google gives a first name
//   only for those), or anywhere the user has written themselves (an outgoing message in the archive this PC keeps).
// The signal chosen is the archive's own record of the user's messages, with the phone's saved contact as a second: both
// are local, neither asks Google anything, and a conversation the user has never written in and whose sender the phone
// does not know gets no card until it is opened.
//
// listedAsSpam (RefusalAsync): how the conversation list shows the conversation this session — null when it does not show it at all.
// The list is the client's, so the client says (IIncomingCards).

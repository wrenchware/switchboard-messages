// Command messages-tailnet is Messages Server's own door on the owner's tailnet (SWITCHBOARD.md 4.7, chosen
// 2026-10-15). It is a Tailscale node of its own inside the server's container (tsnet: userspace, no capability, no
// tun device), so the server is on the tailnet without Unraid publishing its port anywhere but the home network, and
// whatever Unraid's own Tailscale does to its firewall. It ends TLS nowhere: each connection a device makes to it is
// passed byte for byte to the server's relay socket, after one PROXY protocol line naming the device's tailnet address,
// so the server's pinned certificate and device tokens are the same end to end, and its per-address pacing and its
// home-network rule see each device as itself (NetworkHost's relay listener).
//
// Unraid's Tailscale plugin runs tailscaled on the host with its firewall rules on: after it restarts, every packet it
// forwards to a container is masqueraded to the Docker bridge's address, so a server reached through the host's port
// sees all tailnet devices as one (4.7, read from Tailscale's linuxfw source). This door is not subject to that.
//
// The server starts it (TailnetDoor.cs) with a clean environment and reads its standard output: one line per event, fixed
// words, counts and states. The sign-in link and the Tailnet Lock key go to the container's own log, and with the rest of what the
// server's own page shows, in one "tailnet page" line the server keeps in memory for the page and never logs (page.go). Tailscale's own
// log is off (init): nothing is uploaded, and its files in the state folder stay empty. The door ends when its standard
// input ends (the server stopping),
// and on Linux with the server however it ends (parentwatch_linux.go); on Windows the server keeps it in its helpers' job,
// which ends it with the server, and its node's keys are sealed to the user (store_windows.go). With --authkey-stdin the first line of that input
// is a Tailscale auth key for a headless sign-in (MESSAGES_TAILNET_AUTHKEY, readAuthKey), so the key is in no argument
// and no environment. A later "logout" line signs the node out and ends the door with forgetCode (commands). A node that
// Tailscale signs out while it runs asks for a new sign-in link by itself (needsLink).

// Messages has had its own version of this since its background history indexing was found competing with the

// reached the interface thread whether or not anybody was typing. This is the shared one, noted by every composer
// edit and asked at the single point all providers converge: the synchronization apply.
//
// It is deliberately a clock and a timestamp and nothing else. Typing is the most latency-sensitive thing the app
// does, so noting it must cost a single interlocked write and never a lock, an allocation or a dispatch.

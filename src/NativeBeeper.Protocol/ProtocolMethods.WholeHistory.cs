// a client's copy is whole by construction and is drawn at once. A revision is "<epoch>.<number>": the epoch is new whenever the server's store starts
// over, and a revision of another epoch, or older than the conversation's last reset, is answered with a reset (replace your copy, don't patch it).
// Nothing here is journaled: each is a read, and asking again gives the same answer or a newer one.

/// Creating an Instagram group conversation.

/// <remarks>
/// Unlike a first message to one person, nothing here is addressed by a field whose meaning is unsettled: Instagram's
/// create names its recipients as messaging FBIDs outright, which is the id search already returns, and it answers
/// with the new thread's own id rather than leaving it to be looked up. Naming is a second call, so a group that is
/// made and then cannot be named is still a group and is reported as one.
///
/// The create is never retried. Retrying would make a second group, which is visible to everybody in it.

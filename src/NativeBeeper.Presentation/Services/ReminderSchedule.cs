/// <para>The rule. While a reminder is more than <see cref="Lead"/> away, Windows holds it, scheduled under the reminder's
/// record id, and the record says so (<see cref="NotificationRecord.ScheduledFor"/>): that record is the claim-once record
/// every notification already has, so while Windows holds it the app's own delivery finds it claimed and stands down.
/// Within <see cref="Lead"/> of the moment a running Messages takes it back — removes it from Windows' schedule, marks the
/// record TakenBack — and raises it itself at the moment, with everything the running app knows (the words when they may be
/// shown, Pause, whether a snoozed conversation still has anything unread). A reminder Windows no longer holds once its
/// moment has passed was shown by Windows, and is only ended.</para>
/// <para>What that means around a restart. Closed at the moment: Windows shows it; the next start ends it. Started just
/// before it: the first pass takes it back. Started just after: Windows has shown it. Quit inside the last
/// <see cref="Lead"/>, after the app took it back: it comes at the next start, late, as every reminder did before this —
/// nothing is handed back to Windows at quit, because a quit (or a Windows sign-out) is no place for more work, and handing
/// it back would need the record rewritten on the way out. A crash is the same.</para>
/// <para>What Windows shows. Windows keeps a scheduled notification in its own store until it is shown, possibly for days,
/// so a scheduled one never carries the message's words: at most the conversation's name and "Reminder". It follows
/// "Show in notifications" and Pause as they are when it is scheduled, and every change to either (or to notifications
/// being on, or a service being off) builds them again (<see cref="ReconcileAsync"/> with rebuild).</para>
/// <para>Accounts. Signing out of a service removes that service's reminders from Windows; signing back in schedules them
/// again. An account that is merely not known yet (a service still connecting at a start) keeps its reminders with Windows,
/// so a quick restart loses none; if one comes while that account is still unknown, Windows shows it and the app ends it
/// once the account is back. Clicking one whose account has changed (signed out while Messages was closed) goes through the
/// same record checks as every notification, which refuse another connection's record and open nothing of it.</para>

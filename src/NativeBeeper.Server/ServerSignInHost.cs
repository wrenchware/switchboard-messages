/// What <see cref="GoogleSignInKeeper"/> asks of the host that runs it, answered by the server (SWITCHBOARD.md 3.1c). The window answers the same
/// questions from its own state (<c>MainWindow.GoogleRecovery</c>); here each comes from the host:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><see cref="Post"/> is the shell's STA thread, where the renewal's WebView2 lives, as the window's is its interface thread.</item>
/// <item><see cref="UserBusy"/> is what the clients said (<c>client.state</c>): busy if any of them has a dialog open. The keeper reads
/// <see cref="HostClientState"/> itself ahead of this; it is answered the same way so the two cannot disagree.</item>
/// <item><see cref="Closed"/> is the server stopping.</item>
/// <item><see cref="StartupLoad"/> is the launch's own Google connect, which the restore ends.</item>
/// <item><see cref="ReconnectAsync"/> and <see cref="ReloadAfterRelease"/> connect Google Messages only, as the window's
/// <c>ConnectAndLoadAsync(restoreOthers: false)</c> does: nothing else is restored behind a renewal.</item>
/// <item><see cref="PauseSyncAsync"/> does nothing: the window stops its synchronization coordinator (<c>SyncViewModel</c>) around the renewal,
/// and that coordinator, the conversation lists it refreshes and Settings (which the window opens once renewing cannot help) are each client's
/// own. <see cref="ResumeSync"/> is where the window restarted that coordinator and re-read: the host publishes a Google-scoped
/// <c>ResyncRequired</c> in its event log, so every client re-reads what it shows after the helper swap. It is published when a renewal ends
/// however it ended, because a renewal that failed after replacing the helper has changed what a read would answer just as one that worked has.
/// While the swap is under way (the helper replaced, then Google Messages reconnected) a client's Google read fails, with the transient mark the
/// provider puts on "still connecting"; a client waits for the resync rather than retrying in a loop, which is why that is the cue and not a
/// poll. The host's own feed has no loop of its own to stop.</item>
/// </list>

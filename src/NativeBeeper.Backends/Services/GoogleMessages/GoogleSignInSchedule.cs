// What the window does about the Google sign-in's age (MainWindow.GoogleRecovery), apart from the window so it can be
// tested with a clock of its own. Google refuses a sign-in two hours after it was made (GoogleSignInClock).
// - Early: once per sign-in, between 110 and 117 minutes, the kept profile is loaded and its new cookies handed to the
//   running helper, which renews the sign-in before Google refuses it. Only an answer that would come again every time
//   (the profile hands back the same cookies, wants the password, or Google takes them for another account or none)
//   stops it for the run; a dialog, a slow page, a network blip or a reconnect costs that one sign-in's try, not every
//   later one. A new interactive sign-in (a new profile) starts it again.
// - Checks: 20 s after the two hours, and ten minutes later, one read each, so a refusal is heard at once. A sign-in
//   replaced early keeps its checks, in case Google refuses at its mark anyway; if Google does (heard by a check or by
//   anything else), renewing early does not help, and it stops.

// 2026-10-26: someone's first message in an SMS group opened a conversation of its own while it downloaded and moved to the
// group about a second later (GoogleDirectory.IsLeftPlaceholder), so the phone showed, and could notify for, a thread with
// only the sender that then left. A conversation never seen before whose first message is still downloading, or which opens
// with Google's "one-on-one SMS conversation created" marker, is held here until it is settled: released once a message in
// it is whole (a real new conversation: in the logs, a picture from someone new finished 1.2 s later), discarded when its
// message moves on, and released anyway after GoogleMessagesBackend.ArrivalHoldLimit. Over two days of logs every MMS
// download took 1.9 s or less. A plain text from someone new arrives whole and is never held.
